# Solar Energy Optimizer

A Python application that helps optimize electricity usage based on solar PV production and weather forecasts.

## Features

- **Weather Data Integration**: Fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap API for accurate solar irradiance forecasting
- **Solar Production Calculation**: Calculates predicted solar PV output based on weather conditions, panel specifications, and sun angles
- **Appliance Scheduling**: Optimizes timing for high-energy appliances (dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, EV charging)
- **Visual Schedule Display**: Shows daily schedules with green/yellow/red periods indicating solar availability
- **Interactive Plotting**: Creates detailed plots showing solar production vs consumption with appliance markers
- **Cost Savings Analysis**: Calculates potential savings from solar-powered operation
- **Weekly Forecasting**: Provides multi-day planning for energy-intensive tasks
- **Scenario Comparison**: Compare sunny vs cloudy day performance

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This will install:
   - `requests` for API calls
   - `matplotlib` for plotting
   - `numpy` for numerical calculations
3. Get a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Configuration

On first run, the application creates a `config.json` file with default settings. Edit this file to match your system:

```json
{
  "api_key": "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY",
  "solar_system": {
    "panel_wattage": 300,
    "panel_count": 20,
    "efficiency": 0.18,
    "tilt_angle": 30,
    "azimuth_angle": 180,
    "location": {
      "lat": 40.7128,
      "lon": -74.0060
    }
  },
  "appliances": [
    {
      "name": "Dishwasher",
      "power_rating": 1.5,
      "duration": 1.5,
      "flexibility": 8,
      "priority": "medium"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Parameters

- **Solar System**:
  - `panel_wattage`: Watts per panel (e.g., 300W)
  - `panel_count`: Number of panels in your system
  - `efficiency`: Panel efficiency as decimal (18% = 0.18)
  - `tilt_angle`: Panel tilt angle in degrees
  - `azimuth_angle`: Panel orientation (180 = south-facing)
  - `location`: Your latitude and longitude

- **Appliances**:
  - `name`: Appliance name for display
  - `power_rating`: Power consumption in kW
  - `duration`: How long it runs in hours
  - `flexibility`: 0-10 scale (higher = more flexible timing)
  - `priority`: "high", "medium", or "low"

## Usage

### Main Menu Options

1. **Daily Schedule**: Shows today's optimized appliance schedule
2. **Weekly Forecast**: Displays multi-day solar production forecast
3. **Create Visualization Plots**: Generate detailed plots showing solar production and appliance scheduling
4. **Configuration**: View current system settings
5. **Exit**: Quit the application

### Plotting and Visualization

The application now includes comprehensive plotting capabilities:

- **Daily Simulation Plot**: Shows solar production vs consumption with appliance markers
- **Summary Statistics**: Pie charts and bar graphs showing energy distribution
- **Appliance Timeline**: Visual timeline of when each appliance operates
- **Energy Balance**: Breakdown of solar vs grid power usage

#### Running Simulations

```bash
# Quick plot demo
python plot_demo.py

# Full daily simulation with detailed plots
python daily_simulation.py

# Interactive plotting through main application
python main.py
# Then select option 3
```
